# spotify-auto-eq
This program adjusts your system equalizer (Equalizer APO) based on the current Spotify track and output device. It also prefetches the next N tracks and precomputes EQ, so changes are instant on song switch.

## Why does this exist
I always listen to music while working, and I was procrastinating by looking into optimal EQ for my Audio-Technica Headphones, when I thought, each song and each device I use is going to have a different optimal EQ setting. Why think about it when I can make a program to do it automatically? It requires some presets as optimal EQ settings are very subjective, but once it's set up, you will get the best audio for your ears.

## Use Rules
Please feel free to edit and use this program! There are example files for the personal info (i.e., Spotify credentials, device settings) that can all be changed based on your personal machine/credentials. This was made for Windows, but if someone wants to create a program for MacOS go for it! Don't forget to add your audio output device configurations
